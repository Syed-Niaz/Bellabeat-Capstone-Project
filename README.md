# Bellabeat-Capstone-Project
This capstone project is a part of the 'Google Data Analytics' professional certificate.

**Also See**: [Bellabeat.ipynb](https://github.com/Syed-Niaz/Bellabeat-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Bellabeat.ipynb)

It has all the codes used for this project.

## Case Scenario
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.

Bellabeat's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer wants to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. She then wants to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to. The main focus of this case is to analyze smart devices fitness data and determine how it could help unlock new growth opportunities for Bellabeat. 

**Prodct in focus -** Bellabeat app.

## Data Analysis Process
- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act

### 1. Ask

**Business Case Statement**

Identify trends in how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices to apply insights into Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

**Stakeholders:**
- Urška Sršen - Bellabeat cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
- Sando Mur - Bellabeat cofounder and key member of Bellabeat executive team
- Bellabeat Marketing Analytics team

### 2. Prepare

#### 2.1 Dataset
**Link:** [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made available through Mobius.

#### 2.2 Information about dataset
These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

Verifying the metadata of the dataset it can be confirm that it is open-source.

#### 2.3 Details 

Both the files used for this analysis are CSV files.

- **dailyActivity_merged**
  - Daily Activity over 31 days of 33 users. Tracking daily: Steps, Distance, Intensities, Calories
- **sleepDay_merged**
  - Daily sleep logs, tracked by: Total count of sleeps a day, Total minutes, Total Time in Bed

### 3. Process
I will use Python and some of its libraries that are commonly used for data analysis tasks.

#### 3.1 Importing necessary libraries
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

```
#Importing libraries

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```
#### 3.2 Importing datasets

Both the files used for the analysis are CSV files.
- daily_activity
- daily_sleep

```
#importing csv files into dataframes

daily_activity = pd.read_csv(r"D:\PROJECTS\Google DA Capstone\Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16\For Project\dailyActivity.csv")
daily_sleep = pd.read_csv(r"D:\PROJECTS\Google DA Capstone\Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16\For Project\sleepDay.csv")
```

#### 3.3 Data Cleaning & Preparation

This section involves prepping the dataset for the analysis.


- **Case consistency in the column names**

```
#Turning column names to lowercase for consistency

daily_activity.columns = daily_activity.columns.str.lower()
daily_sleep.columns = daily_sleep.columns.str.lower()
```
- **Removing some unnessary columns**

```
###Removing unncessary columns

#In daily_activity df 'totalDistance' and 'tranckerdistance' seems to have the same data. Remove 'trackerdistance' column

daily_activity.drop(columns='trackerdistance', inplace= True)


#Drop LoggedActivitiesDistance from daily_activity

daily_activity.drop(columns='loggedactivitiesdistance', inplace = True)


#SedentaryActiveDistance doesn't add any value and is pretty much useless so it will be remove it

daily_activity.drop(columns='sedentaryactivedistance', inplace = True)
```
- **Round 'totaldistance' column to 2 decimal places**

```
#Changing 'totaldistance' to 2 decimal places

daily_activity['totaldistance'] = daily_activity['totaldistance'].round(decimals= 2)
```

- **Identifying number of users**

Verifying number of users in datasets
```
daily_activity['id'].nunique()
```
33

People who used their devices daily.
```
daily_sleep['id'].nunique()
```
24

People who used their devices even during sleeping.
```
daily_activity['id'].nunique() - daily_sleep['id'].nunique()
```
9

People who used their devices daily but probably took them off during before their sleep.

- **Removing Duplicates**
```
#Removing duplicates

daily_sleep.drop_duplicates(inplace= True)

#check

sum(daily_sleep.duplicated())
```
0

- **Changing Data Format**

Changing 'activitydate' & 'sleepday' columns to datetime format
```
daily_activity['activitydate'] = pd.to_datetime(daily_activity['activitydate'])
daily_sleep['sleepday'] = pd.to_datetime(daily_sleep['sleepday'])
```

To merge the 'daily_activity' & 'daily_sleep' dataframes we want to maintain date format consistency, 
so we will ignore the time part of 'sleepday' column in 'daily_sleep' dataframe

```
daily_sleep['sleepday'] = pd.to_datetime(daily_sleep['sleepday']).dt.date
```

The 'sleepday' column data format needs to be changed again and renamed.
```
daily_sleep['sleepday'] = pd.to_datetime(daily_sleep['sleepday'])

daily_sleep.rename(columns= {'sleepday':'activitydate'}, inplace= True)
```

- **Merging Dataframes**

Merging the two tables 'daily_activity' and 'daily_sleep' and forming a new merged dataframe 'daily_activity_sleep' will allow us to see data from both tables in a single table.

```
#Merging 'daily_activity' and 'daily_sleep' datasets

df_activity_sleep = pd.merge(left = daily_activity, right = daily_sleep, on = ['id', 'activitydate'], how = "inner")
```

### 4. Analyze & Share

**Group By**

Grouping By 'id' will allow the process of doing calculations for each user a lot easier.

```
#group by id for 'df_activity_sleep'

groupby_id_activity_sleep = df_activity_sleep.groupby(by='id')
```

```
#group by id for 'daily_activity' df

groupby_id_daily_activity = daily_activity.groupby(by= 'id')
```

```
#group by 'id' for 'daily_sleep'

groupby_id_daily_sleep = daily_sleep.groupby(by='id')
```

Creating a dataframe 'avg_data' with some average datas of each category as per 'id' and then resetting the index

```
avg_data = groupby_id_activity_sleep.mean()

#resetting the index

avg_data.reset_index(inplace=True)

avg_data
```

**User Type - Avg Steps daily Visualization**

Finding the average number of steps walked daily by each user and then plot that into a chart.

```
#changing 'id' to string type for plotting bar chart

avg_data['id']= avg_data['id'].astype('str')
```


```
#adjust figure size, label font size, and axis font size

plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
plt.rc('axes', titlesize=15)
plt.rc('axes', labelsize=15)
plt.rc('xtick', labelsize=10)
plt.rc('ytick', labelsize=10)

#Horizontal Barchart and values Sorted by 'totalsteps' in ascending order

plt.barh(avg_data['id'], avg_data['totalsteps'].sort_values(ascending=True))

#labeling

plt.xlabel('Avg Steps')
plt.ylabel('ID')
plt.title('Avg Steps walked daily per user')

plt.show()
```

**User Classification - Avg Steps**

Classifyinh users based on the average number of steps they walked daily. 

The following benchmarks are set for classification:

- Sedentary - Less than 5000 steps a day
- Lightly Active - Between 5000 and 7499 steps a day
- Fairly Active - Between 7500 and 9999 steps a day
- Very Active - 10000 steps or more a day

This benchmark is used as a reference to set the conditons in the code.

```
#adding a conditional column 'user_type' based on average total steps per user

conditions = [
    (avg_data['totalsteps'] >= 10000),
    (avg_data['totalsteps'] >= 7500) & (avg_data['totalsteps'] < 10000),
    (avg_data['totalsteps'] >= 5000) & (avg_data['totalsteps'] < 7500),
    (avg_data['totalsteps'] < 5000)
]

values = ['very active', 'fairly active', 'lightly active', 'sedentary']

avg_data['user_type'] = np.select(conditions, values)

#round the dataframe values to 2 decimal places

avg_data = avg_data.round(2)

avg_data
```
Making a new dataframe 'user_type_percentage' based on **User Classification**

```
df_user_type = avg_data[['id','user_type']]

#proportion of each user_type value to total in % into a dataframe

user_type_percentage = df_user_type['user_type'].value_counts(normalize= True)*100

user_type_percentage = pd.DataFrame(data= user_type_percentage)


#round to 2 decimal places

user_type_percentage = user_type_percentage.round(2)

user_type_percentage

#reset the index

user_type_percentage.reset_index(inplace= True)

#rename the columns properly

user_type_percentage.rename(columns={'index':'user_type',
                                    'user_type': 'perc_total'}, inplace= True)
                                    
user_type_percentage
```

**User Classification - Avg Steps Visualization**

```
#USER CATEGORY- Pie Chart of the users categorized by their activity level which is measured by their avg daily steps

#formating fig size and label

plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
plt.rc('axes', titlesize=15)


#Pie Chart

plt.pie(user_type_percentage['perc_total'], labels= user_type_percentage['user_type'], autopct='%1.1f%%')

plt.title('User Type %')

plt.legend()

plt.show()
```

**Correlations**

We will test the correlation between using a scatter plot to better understand the following relationships:
- Total steps and calories
- Total steps and minutes slept

It is also important to keep in mind that correaltion does not mean causation.

```
#CORRELATION between steps & calories

plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))


#Scatter Plot with Seaborn

sns.regplot(x= 'totalsteps', y= 'calories', data = daily_activity, scatter_kws= {"color": "blue"}, line_kws= {"color": "red"})

plt.title('Total Steps VS Calories')

plt.show()
```

![This is an image](https://github.com/Syed-Niaz/Bellabeat-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Total%20Steps%20VS%20Calories.png)

```
From the visualizations we can see that there is a moderate positive correlation between total steps and calories, which is expected as the more steps someone walks the more calories they burn

#CORRELATION between steps & sleep

plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))

#Scatter Plot with seaborn

sns.regplot(x= 'totalsteps', y= 'totalminutesasleep', data = df_activity_sleep, scatter_kws= {"color": "blue"}, line_kws= {"color": "red"})

plt.title('Total Steps VS Total Minutes Slept')
plt.show()
```

![This is an image](https://github.com/Syed-Niaz/Bellabeat-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Total%20Steps%20VS%20Total%20Minutes%20Slept.png)


From the visualizations we can see that there is a low negtaive correaltion between total steps and minutes slept indicates the more active might actually get less asleep



**Device Usage**

```
#The number of days device was worn but with 1 less day

days_worn = groupby_id_daily_activity['activitydate'].max() - groupby_id_daily_activity['activitydate'].min()
```
Create a 'days_worn' dataframe
```
days_worn = pd.DataFrame(days_worn)

#resetting index

days_worn.reset_index(inplace=True)

#first converting 'activitydate' col value into str so split function can be used to separate 'days' term

days_worn['activitydate'] = days_worn['activitydate'].astype('str')

#spilting away 'days' term from the column

x= days_worn['activitydate'].str.split(' ', expand= True)

#adding the separated column to our 'days_worn' df

days_worn['activitydate']= x[0]

days_worn['activitydate'] = days_worn['activitydate'].astype('int')

#Add the 1 day to fix the final 'days_worn' df

days_worn['activitydate'] = days_worn['activitydate']+1

#renaming column appropriately

days_worn.rename(columns={'activitydate': 'days'}, inplace= True)

days_worn
```

```
#adding a conditional column 'use' based on days device was used/worn per user

conditions = [
    (days_worn['days'] >= 21),
    (days_worn['days'] >= 11) & (days_worn['days'] <= 20),
    (days_worn['days'] <= 10)
]

values = ['high use', 'moderate use', 'low use']

days_worn['use'] = np.select(conditions, values)

days_worn

```
**User Classification - Device Usage**

```
days_worn_perc = days_worn['use'].value_counts(normalize=True)*100

days_worn_perc = pd.DataFrame(days_worn_perc)

days_worn_perc= round(days_worn_perc, 2)

days_worn_perc.reset_index(inplace=True)

days_worn_perc.rename(columns={'index':'use_level',
                                    'user_type': 'perc_total'}, inplace= True)

days_worn_perc
```

**User Classification - Device Usage Visualization**

**User Sleep Pattern**

Time to look into the sleep patter of the users. We will look into the following stats in comparison to each other:
- Time in bed
- Time asleep
- Time taken to fall asleep

```
#putting it in a df and resetting the index

avg_sleep= groupby_id_daily_sleep.mean()

avg_sleep.reset_index(inplace= True)

avg_sleep
```

```
#Let's see how long user's are in bed when they are not asleep
#could indicate bad sleeping habits

avg_sleep['time_to_fall_asleep'] = avg_sleep['totaltimeinbed'] - avg_sleep['totalminutesasleep']

#change 'id' dtype to str so it can be used as a label

avg_sleep['id']= avg_data['id'].astype('str')

avg_sleep
```

**Users' Sleep Pattern Visualization**

```
#change 'id' dtype to str so it can be used as a label

avg_sleep['id']= avg_data['id'].astype('str')
```

```
#formating the figuresize and font

plt.bar(x=avg_sleep['id'], height=avg_sleep['totaltimeinbed'], label= "Time in Bed", )
plt.bar(x=avg_sleep['id'], height=avg_sleep['totalminutesasleep'], label= "Avg min Slept", )
plt.bar(x=avg_sleep['id'], height=avg_sleep['time_to_fall_asleep'], label= "min to Fall Asleep")

plt.title('Sleep Pattern')

### 5. Act

**Sleep Alert**

Even after getting in bed some users tend to fall asleep later. This may indicate bad bedtime habits like using the phone in bed or also indicate that they have trouble falling asleep. 
- **Warning Alert Notification** to send a message to users to stop using their phones.
- **Content Recommendation** (blog or video) to users who struggle falling asleep about how they can improve their sleeping habits . Content recommendation should be sent at a time based on user sleep patter so that users doesn't start watching the content while they are in bed.

**Daily Notifications**

- Steps covered
- Calories burned

**Rewards**

Customers can get rewards based on their activity level. As per the benchmark set. 'Active Users' may qualify for rewards like customer points or discounts on their next purchase of a Bellabeat product. Thus encouraging a healthier lifestyle and may also increase sales.
